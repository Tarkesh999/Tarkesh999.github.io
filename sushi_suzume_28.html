<h2>Hey dumbo! Congratulations on cracking this, glad you decoded smartyyyy</h2>

<p> this is going to be long shit, put on your seat belts and welcome aboard! <br/>
<br/>
I know we both dont give a shit about birthdays but i found this a way to communicate with you after an ocean of no-communication silence. Btw Happy Birthday ha ha ha! you are just getting an year older and aging like fine wine lol! <br/>
<br/>
You Missed me? Did I miss you? We may lie and say no but the little things around us from mosquito to music prove us wrong as we can’t escape the lingering thoughts<br/>
<br/>
“May be in another life time I find you again and it will be different” <br/>
<br/>
Only if I could re-wind to the point where I was pointing at virtual stars to you when we first met?  <br/>
  <br/>
Only if I could tell this during our initial walks when we sat at the circle…”Just don’t fuck it up Sushiiii!!” <br/>
  <br/>
Only if our integrity was strong and the fake promises were a hoax? <br/>
  <br/>
Only if we travelled the world further to unlock memories that would have got the Suzume Season 4 a sensational hit and by then you would have reached 1.6969e69 of your cringe statements? List goes on…my overthinking mind is a mess you know xD <br/>
<br/>
Let’s come back to reality, I have been hurt enough..things can never ever go back! That is the truth!!! <br/>
  <br/>
But no matter what you are special to me(tbh i still have no clue what special means..) and I always prayed and wished you stay super cheerful! Ur door screetch laughter for lame things is the ultimate vibe!! <br/>
  <br/>
Willain Shakespeare kicked in me to make you senti ante... by now if you got senti my evil plan is successful, if not then ummm I need to try better. <br/>
  <br/>
Sushi I have ton lot of things to share with you,<br/>
I miss the days where we used to talk for hours about 100s of contrast topics not getting bored even a second(ur friends’ life histories is an exception),<br/>
  last few months have been crazyyy with crazyy transitions going on!…<br/>
  2024 has been like “fuck OMg what’s going on!!…okay!! Okay makes sense!!” . <br/>
  By now it’s good that we got used to this separation and it is funny like how Im talking like “nothing has happened between us “ .<br/>
  I have met some of my friends’ girlfriends and realised none of them were even close to the vibe we had! <br/>
  The memories we created is a holy grail that I can live on cherishing but these sweet memories are a bit sour in taste. <br/>
  Thats how things turned in an year. Life is so unpredictable lol!<br/>
  
  But trust me Sushi, you are a princess in my heart forever! I was and I am a fucking simp for you and an admirer for Sushi from Solapur. <br/> 
  You were my girl! Don’t let anybody put you down!! Ik you are strongg!! Fruten Fraten babyyy!! <br/>

  <br/> Overthink cheyaku, chill avu manchiga, nenu Bglr lo crazy chill avtuna!! <br/> 

<br/><br/><br/>
Photos link didn't work kada...."Life is unfair babyy! :) ^_^ " <br/> <br/>
Sarae chaalu inka na sollu! Very rare that I text long shit but yeah!..Manyy more happy returns of the day once again….Have a blast, stay cheerful and stay away from nashe(recall the promises we made)…just a caution! 
<br/>

<br> If you read till here, ask Meenu to text me "Fruten Fraten!!!" </br>
Adios :) </p>
